Here are the technical capabilities identified from the codebase:

* **Data Storage:** The codebase utilizes a relational database (likely PostgreSQL or MySQL) for storing user and loan information. This is evident from the SQL queries used in the `loanFactoryTest.js` file.
* **Event Streaming:** While not explicitly mentioned, the use of `nock` in the `loanFactoryTest.js` file suggests the potential for event streaming. `nock` is a library for mocking HTTP requests, which is often used in event-driven architectures.
* **Observability:** The codebase includes `status.js` files in various services, which provide basic health checks and status information. This indicates a basic level of observability.
* **CI/CD:** The codebase includes test files (`installmentPlansTest.js`, `loanFactoryTest.js`, `providerVerificationTest.js`) and uses `chai` and `chaiHttp` for testing. This suggests the presence of automated testing and potentially CI/CD pipelines.
* **Document Storage:** The codebase includes a `document-generation-service`, which implies the ability to store and manage documents. However, the specific storage mechanism is not clear from the provided code.
* **Process Automation:** The codebase includes a `loan-factory-service` that automates the loan creation process, including user creation, scoring, and installment plan calculation. This demonstrates process automation capabilities.
* **Distributed Tracing:** The codebase uses `nock` to mock HTTP requests, which can be used to simulate distributed tracing. However, the code does not explicitly implement distributed tracing.
* **Service mesh:** The codebase uses `consul` for service discovery, which is a common component of service meshes. This suggests the potential for a service mesh implementation.
* **Database Backup:** The codebase does not explicitly mention database backup capabilities.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** The codebase does not explicitly mention infrastructure as code capabilities.
* **Digital Signatures:** The codebase does not explicitly mention digital signature capabilities.
