The scoring service evaluates loan applications and determines approval or rejection. The installment plan calculator service generates installment plans based on loan parameters. The authentication service provides authentication and authorization for other services. The document generation service generates documents such as termsheets and invoices. The loan factory service orchestrates the interaction between these services to process loan applications.
